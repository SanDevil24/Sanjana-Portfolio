      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Sanjana, a mathematics and computer science student seeking a position as a cryptography or data science 
        intern, utilizing my growing knowledge in mathematics and computer science, and in pursuit of expanding my 
        knowledge in mathematics, cyber security, data visualization, and development coding to solve real world problems.

          <h3>Grocery & Inventory Tracker (G.I.T)</h3>
          <p>
            I created an app independently that helps users track their inventory for supplies at home, helps create 
            a grocery list for the user, and calculate the cost for supplies for each week. I used Swift and Flutter 
            for coding and programming, and used Violet UML to explain the flow of my app.

          <h3>Save Or Spend (S.O.S) Personal Finance Tracker</h3>
          <p>
            I created an app with a group of friends that helps users track their monthly finances, notifies users
            about deadlines and paydays,  and helps users set limitations on their savings and spending.
            We used Android Studio, XML, and Java for coding and programming, and used Violet UML to explain 
            the flow of our app.

          <h3>Federal And State Tax (F.A.S.T) Software</h3>
          <p>
            I studied and researched regarding student’s difficulty with financial literacy, and pitched a business
            idea to create a program to help students, foreigners, and graduates file their taxes in a simple manner
            with a group of friends. We developed business proposal, code, and website, using Google and Office Applications,
            Canva, Java, and HTML, and presented to an audience.

          <h3>SMARCAL1's Activity on DNA Replication and Fork Regression</h3>
          <p>
            I studied and tracked how activity of SMARCAL1 protein can be controlled by Homologous Recombination protein 
            RPA during DNA Replication and Fork Regression by visualizing data, performing scientific methods like gel 
            electrophoresis, pull down assay, fork regression assay, purification. I developed research proposal and 
            poster, generated images, and typed research proposal using Google Applications.
